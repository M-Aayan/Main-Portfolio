# Main-Portfolio
I initially designed my portfolio in Figma, focusing on creating a modern and visually appealing layout that showcases my skills, projects, and experience. The design emphasizes usability, with clean sections, intuitive navigation, and responsive elements.

Now, I'm converting this design into a functional project using HTML and CSS. The website features an engaging hero section, well-structured project showcases, and interactive hover effects. In the future, I plan to enhance it further by adding JavaScript for dynamic functionality, such as form validation, smooth scrolling, and modal popups for project details.

The portfolio is designed to perform seamlessly across devices, ensuring an optimal user experience with a responsive layout that adjusts beautifully to different screen sizes. Its aesthetic complements my personal brand, combining professionalism with creativity.
